## Notes

- See the [raw source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020/github-pages-starter/master/_posts/2019-04-13-measles-charts.md) of this post for details on how these charts were embedded.
- See the [lecture 13A slides](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020/week-13/blob/master/lecture-13A.ipynb) for the code that produced these plots.

**Important: When embedding charts, you will likely need to adjust the width/height of the charts before embedding them in the page so they fit nicely when embedded.**
