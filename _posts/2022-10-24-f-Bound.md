This post includes state-level population estimates by year (with different strategies dealing with missing response in self-reported LGB identity).

*Note: An empty bar means no YRBS data available for that state-year.*

## Self-Reported LGB Identity

The overlay bar chart below is derived from the following question:

Which of the following best describes you?
- A. Heterosexual (straight)
- B. Gay or lesbian
- C. Bisexual
- D. Not sure
- NA

*Note:*
- *"Not sure" is coded as not LGB.*
- *"NA": missing response*
- ***Lower bound**: impute all missing response as 0*
- ***Observed prevalence**: assuming Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanism*
- ***Heckman prevalence**: assuming complex missing data mechanism, Missing at Random (MAR) or Missing Not at Random (MNAR)* (to be added)
- ***Upper bound**: impute all missing response as 1*
